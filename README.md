# Kanji App
![kanji app](https://i.imgur.com/qwPKRWl.png)

Simple game-like app to learn/memorize kanji characters according to the kyōiku system. 
The "game" consists of a set of *n* kanjis that are generated and the user must type the proper meaning and readings. After completing all the kanjis of the list the user is rated from 0 to 1 based on efficiency.

It supports configuration which include number of kanjis to generate, which readings/meanings to require, which grades to include, and displaying the "serif" version or not.

The **"show hints"** option just the answer in a faded text.

## Known Issues & Future
- Some adjusts may be needed for the mobile version, specially regarding size of some inputs and margin/padding.
- There are some kanjis which lack certain readings, for example 孝 lacks a kun'yomi reading thus appearing as "-". So, if the app configuration is set to only one type of reading (eg kun'yomi), these kanjis should be avoided when the initial array is generated.
- An option of uploading custom sets of kanjis may be added
- A better branding and overall design is needed, currently it's extremely boring and bland looking
